  <title>Student Learning Outcomes</title>
  <p>
    Mathematics students will see how formalizing arguments in Lean can reveal hidden assumptions, refine logical thinking, and spark fresh insights, even for well<ndash/>known theorems.
    Lean also serves as a platform for cutting<ndash/>edge mathematical research, with extensive libraries of verified results that encourage meaningful contributions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Computer Science students will discover how Lean’s type<ndash/>theoretic foundations apply to verifying algorithms, cryptographic protocols, and large<ndash/>scale software systems, reinforcing a correctness<ndash/>first mindset essential to modern development.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of the course, you will be prepared to produce fully machine<ndash/>checked proofs, apply formal methods to real<ndash/>world challenges, and collaborate effectively with mathematicians and software engineers alike, bridging the gap between theoretical vision and practical reliability.
