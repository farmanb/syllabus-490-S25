  "body": " Course Information   Course Description  This course provides a hands-on introduction to formal verification and computer-assisted proof development using the Lean theorem prover. You will learn how to represent mathematical concepts in a precise formal language, construct and verify proofs interactively, and leverage automated techniques to eliminate logical errors. Along the way, you’ll explore core ideas from logic, type theory, and proof strategies that can be applied to create robust formalizations of everything from classical theorems to complex software specifications.    Course Prerequisites  A grade of C or better in MATH 307, MATH 311, or CSC 220.    Student Learning Outcomes  Mathematics students will see how formalizing arguments in Lean can reveal hidden assumptions, refine logical thinking, and spark fresh insights, even for well known theorems. Lean also serves as a platform for cutting edge mathematical research, with extensive libraries of verified results that encourage meaningful contributions.  Computer Science students will discover how Lean’s type theoretic foundations apply to verifying algorithms, cryptographic protocols, and large scale software systems, reinforcing a correctness first mindset essential to modern development.  By the end of the course, you will be prepared to produce fully machine checked proofs, apply formal methods to real world challenges, and collaborate effectively with mathematicians and software engineers alike, bridging the gap between theoretical vision and practical reliability.    Course Topics  This course provides an introduction to formal verification and computer-assisted proof development using Lean. Students will explore the following topics    Understanding Mathematical Statements: Learning how to write and check logical statements and rules in Lean.     Building Proofs Step by Step: Using tools and techniques to create clear and logical arguments.     Defining and Working with Data: Exploring how to represent data like numbers, lists, and trees in Lean.     Writing and Reasoning About Programs: Understanding how to write small programs and prove they work correctly.     Handling Complex Computations with Monads: Simplifying advanced programming tasks using special tools in Lean.     Checking Algorithms: Ensuring common algorithms, like sorting, are correct and reliable through formal proofs.     Foundations of Logic and Mathematics: Exploring the deeper structure of logic, types, and mathematical rules.       Instructional Methods  This course is offered as a face-to-face course. Learning will be facilitated through traditional lecture, group work\/activities, homework, and in-class assessments.   "

  "body": " Evaluation   Participation and Engagement  Active participation is essential for success in this course. Students are expected to attend all classes, contribute to discussions, and engage in collaborative activities. This includes asking questions, sharing insights, and working effectively during in-class exercises or group work.  Constructive engagement allows students to deepen their understanding of the material, learn from their peers, and build essential problem-solving and communication skills that will be valuable in future coursework and careers.    Homework  Homework assignments are a critical component of the course. They are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures and provide hands-on experience using Lean. Assignments will include a mix of logical proofs, programming tasks, and conceptual exercises. Solutions must be submitted on time and will be graded for clarity and correctness. Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must submit their own work.    Projects   Projects are a significant component of the course, giving students the opportunity to apply their knowledge to formalize and verify mathematical or computational concepts in Lean. These projects will build problem-solving skills, encourage creativity, and allow students to explore the potential of interactive theorem proving. Both the midterm and final projects will be evaluated based on technical accuracy, clarity of exposition, creativity, and teamwork.    Midterm Project  Students will work in small groups to formalize a specific problem or proof in Lean. The midterm project will focus on a foundational topic, with structured guidance provided to ensure students develop proficiency in key skills.     Final Project  The final project will allow students to choose from a list of complex problems that align with their interests and demonstrates their mastery of course material. Projects will require students to design and implement creative solutions, formalize their work in Lean, and present their work to the class.      Quizzes  Quizzes will be administered periodically to assess understanding of key concepts and ensure students are keeping up with the material. These will be short, focused assessments designed to reinforce learning and identify areas for improvement. Quizzes may include logical proofs, questions about Lean syntax, or problem-solving tasks. They are an opportunity to practice applying course concepts and receive feedback on your progress.    Weights  Grades will be calculated using the weights below.
